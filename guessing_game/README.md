## Introduction

This is a fun and simple project to get started with Rust. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user can select a mode to either play the game as a human player or let the computer attempt to guess the number. The game will provide feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

This project is a modified version of the guessing game from Chapter 2 of "The Rust Programming Language" book.
